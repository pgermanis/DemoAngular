June 17th 2024: Big update released!

The entire course was re-recorded from scratch and was therefore completely updated! It's now 100% up-to-date with the latest version of Angular again, covering crucial modern features like signals, standalone components etc.

Many new deep-dive sections on these core topics were added, hence ensuring that you learn ALL about modern Angular in-depth. In addition, the course also still covers older Angular versions & syntax, so that you get the most out of this course, no matter with which Angular version you're working.

May 23rd 2024: New "Essentials" Sections!

Brand-new "Essentials" sections were added, covering modern Angular (incl. standalone components, signals, new control flow & more) from the ground up.

This course therefore once again teaches modern Angular, whilst also teaching "older" Angular features since many projects are still stuck on old Angular versions. With this course, you'll be ready to work with Angular, no matter which version you might be using in your next project!

Hear what my students have to say

"Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse"

"The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!"

"As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand."

This Course uses TypeScript

TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.

TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.

Why Angular?

Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.

Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.

Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (= Angular 2+) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.

Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications

This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them correctly.

Specifically you will learn:

Which architecture Angular uses

How to use TypeScript to write Angular applications

All about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives/ components

How databinding works

All about routing and handling navigation

What pipes are and how to use them

How to send HTTP requests (e.g. to REST APIs)

What dependency injection is and how to use it

How to use modules in Angular

How to optimize your (bigger) Angular applications
